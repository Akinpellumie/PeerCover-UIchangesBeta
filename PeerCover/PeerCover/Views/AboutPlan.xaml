Compulsory Insurances are those insurance policies which every person must have or face penalties for default and it is therefore important for people know what insurance policies are compulsory. In Nigeria, there are six (6) insurance policies made compulsory by the law. It is important to emphasize that these six (6) classes of Insurance are made compulsory under their enabling laws and failure to comply with the law is regarded as a criminal offence and employees can also sue for compensation in a civil suit. The policies and their relevant legislation are as follows:

1.1 Motor Third Party Insurance as required by the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act of 1950. This is the minimum insurance that owners of motor vehicles plying Nigerian roads are required to have. The policy covers liability for death or bodily injury to a third party arising from the use of the vehicle. Section 68 of the Insurance Act 2003 extends the liability to cover damage to the property of a third party to the tune of One Million Naira.

Section 9(3) of that Act requires every employer of labour with five (5) or more employees to take out a life insurance policy for a minimum of three times the annual total emolument of the employee. This law is applicable to both private and public sector employees. Failure to comply with this provision is an offence punishable with imprisonment for up to one year or a fine of N250,000 or  both.

1.3 Health Care Professional Indemnity as required by the National Health Insurance Scheme Act of 1999.

The law defines a health care provider as any registered Government or private healthcare practitioner and hospital or maternity center.

1.4 Insurance of Public Buildings as required by the Insurance Act of 2003. Section 65 of that Act requires the owner or occupier of every public building to be insured against liability for loss or damage to property or death or bodily injury caused by collapse, fire, earthquake, storm or flood.
